This repository belongs to the **Public Sector Research Portfolio** of FAAIR and addresses the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence, Ecology, and Climate Resilience**.  
It focuses on the development of a digital AI platform to monitor and predict wetland health using historical ecological data from the Nalsarovar Bird Sanctuary ‚Äì a designated Ramsar site in Gujarat, India.

---

## Objective

To build an AI-powered digital platform that ingests and analyzes multi-year wetland data, visualizes ecological trends, and provides actionable insights for policymakers, ecologists, and forest officers to ensure sustainable management of the Nalsarovar ecosystem.

---

## Key Goals

- Digitize and standardize physico-chemical and biological data from GEER Foundation archives  
- Build predictive AI models for critical ecological parameters (e.g., dissolved oxygen, algal bloom risk)  
- Offer trend visualizations for long-term environmental planning  
- Enable policy-makers to make data-backed wetland conservation decisions  
- Integrate climate forecasting, migratory bird patterns, and water quality data  

---

## System Architecture

The solution includes the following modules:

- **Data Integration**: Multi-year wetland datasets (historical and live sensor feeds)  
- **Preprocessing Pipeline**: Cleansing, normalization, seasonal tagging  
- **AI Models**: Time-series prediction, anomaly detection, ecological forecasting  
- **Visualization Layer**: Dashboards, heatmaps, risk prediction overlays  
- **Policy & Alerts Engine**: Generates risk reports, conservation suggestions, and alerts  

*A detailed block diagram is available in the `assets/` folder.*
